# Responsible Disclosure Statement

This project was developed as part of an **academic security analysis**
focused on digital ticket validation systems used in
**proof-of-payment public transport models**.

The goal of this work is to evaluate potential **security and design risks**
and propose **constructive, improvement-oriented solutions**, following
industry best practices and ethical guidelines.

## Scope of the Analysis

The scope of this project is intentionally limited to:

- Visual-only digital ticket validation mechanisms
- High-level threat modeling and risk assessment
- UI-based proof-of-concept demonstration
- Security-by-design discussion and recommendations

Out of scope:

- Backend systems or databases
- Real-world exploitation or service misuse
- Automated bypass techniques
- Distribution of operational or sensitive implementation details

## Ethical Considerations

This project was conducted under the following principles:

- No real-world exploitation was performed
- No unauthorized access to systems or services occurred
- No financial or service-related advantage was obtained
- No sensitive code, secrets, or internal logic are published
- The proof-of-concept is strictly visual and demonstrative

The repository intentionally limits technical depth to prevent misuse.
